## NestJS
### Setup the environment, Create Nextjs App 
- npx create-next-app@latest next-app.
-  We suggest that you begin by typing:
   * cd next-app
   * npm i (if node module is not installed )
   * npm run dev.

## components
- Component starts as a function
     ` 
       const Cat = () => {};
     `
- You can think of components as blueprints. Whatever a function component returns is rendered as a React element. 
    React elements let you describe what you want to see on the screen.
